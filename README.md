### What is our main idea?

Scientia DAO is the first DAO Community for Scientists & Researchers.

Researchers from around the world can become a DAO member and share their researches, studies and a lot more!

We want to create a decentralized and community-driven world of scientists and researchers without third-party elements.

### How did we manage the project?

In order to come up with this idea, Dhruv Agarwal, Kushagra Sarathe, Aditya Gupta and Nils Giebing have sat together and brainstormed. The direction was clear - Medicine and/or science. 

After the second session we came up with the idea of this project and its name - Scientia DAO. Scientia is latin and means ‘science’. Science in its purest form.

We have set up a GitHub repository and began planning using Notion. First we wrote the smart contracts to come up with the logic behind the DAO. Soon we needed some first visualizations in order to keep going creating more ideas, logic and the dependend components.

We met up via various online meeting tools to discuss, collaborate and even learn from one another!

### How can someone join the DAO?

In order for someone to join the DAO, he/she has to click the "Join DAO"-Button on our homepage. A register form will appear where you can paste your name, bio, field of research and maybe even previous researches. After pasting your information, hit the "Submit Proposal"-button to start the joining-proposal.

The first 50 people can join the DAO directly after paying the inital deposit of 0.05 Ether. After the 50 first members, members can only join after being voted by te other DAO members into the DAO.
